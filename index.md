# Creative Waste

As foreign students, plastic and packaging waste is one of the issues we realised when we look around Tainan. We see restaurants and sellers giving us plastic whenever we want it, even though it is unnecessary. We always get plastic cups when we drink, one-use chopsticks when we eat, and a new sheet of paper every time when we make our order. This is a serious problem that we encounter every day.

## When

1. Shuixian Gong Market; 9 October 2019 12:00-15:30
2. Fukurou, a package-free store; 22 October 2019, 17:00-19:30

## How did we get there

- by bus (as tourists)
- by bike, scooter and on foot (as locals)

## How did we communicate

- chats when purchasing their goods
- informal interviews

## How did we combine and compare those two cases

In our first visit, we observed how plastic and packaging waste is made in one of the most famous market in Tainan; while in the second one, we saw how the locals try to reduce the waste.


## With whom 

- locals and shopkeepers

We thought of one place - Shuixian Gong Market, the food market with the longest history of 300+ years in Tainan. Some people already hinted us that mostly elderlies go there to shop, so it looks like a perfect place to explore local problems and talk about them with the locals. We expect to investigate the core issues of food wasting and all trash creation in Tainan and find some nifty improvements that could be implemented.

Taiwanese or Tainanese street are usually really clean. We canâ€™t see there many litters or waste despite the fact of frequent take-aways and lack of trash bins. But sometimes we can come across these streets that are full of waste.

This is for us - foreign, exchange students - really confusing and we assume that if the cleanness of the streets were not taken care of by as many people as we see, most streets would look similar. This should be a warning for all of us.
