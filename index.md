# Creative Waste

As foreign students, plastic and packaging waste is one of the issues we realised when we look around Tainan. We see restaurants and sellers giving us plastic whenever we want it, even though it is unnecessary. We always get plastic cups when we drink, one-use chopsticks when we eat, and a new sheet of paper every time when we make our order. This is a serious problem that we encounter every day.

### When

1. Shuixian Gong Market; 9 October 2019 12:00-15:30
2. Fukurou, a package-free store; 22 October 2019, 17:00-19:30

## How did we get there

- by bus (as tourists)
- by bike, scooter and on foot (as locals)



## How did we document the visits

- photos and note jotting


## How did we communicate

- chats when purchasing their goods
- informal interviews

## How did we combine and compare those two cases

In our first visit, we observed how plastic and packaging waste is made in one of the most famous market in Tainan; while in the second one, we saw how the locals try to reduce the waste.


## With whom 

- locals and shopkeepers
